### Dependencies

This project is developed  using Python 3.7  and all the dependencies are  listed in requirements.txt

### API bank  ðŸ‘‹
Unzip API bank data

```console
unzip API-bank-data.zip 
```
How to get the summary of API bank data (e.g the total number of APIs,  the number of added APIs, ...)

```
python API_stat.py
```

### Dataset 

The folder dataset contains three files. 

1. dataset/all.selected.notebooks  6004 notebook project considered in this project. This is a csv file where each of lines has the detailed information such as its GitHub link, Python version, selected notebook and environment file.
2. dataset/snifferdog.executable.notebooks  507 notebook project are executed by  SnifferDog. This is a csv file where each of lines has the detailed information such as its GitHub link, Python version, selected notebook and environment file.
3. dataset/all.github.urls  all 100k notebook projects  


### How to execute a notebook automatically ?

To replicate our results that 507 notebooks are executed by SnifferDog. You need first import the enviornment and then activate the environment.  All the 507 envrionment configrations are in the folder ./ yml/.  The following two script will help you to do this. Please note that the environment name for a project is the same as the project ID in the dataset file (the first column is the project ID)

1. import an environment.  
```
conda env create --name project_ID --file=project_ID.yml
```

2. To execute a notebook
```
conda activate project_ID
python run_jupyter.py   notebookfile
conda deactivate
```

### How to  do API mapping for a Python library ?

1. Download the releases of the library.
```
python download_lib_versions.py  libraryname
```
2. Run the lib_API_mapping.py file
```
python lib_API_mapping.py release_data_dir  libraryname
```
Please note that the program will output a json file for the given library to store its API information
